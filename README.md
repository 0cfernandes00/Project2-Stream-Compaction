CUDA Stream Compaction

**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 1**

* (TODO) YOUR NAME HERE
* Tested on: (TODO) Windows 22, i7-2222 @ 2.22GHz 22GB, GTX 222 222MB (Moore 2222 Lab)

### (TODO: Your README)

Include analysis, etc. (Remember, this is public, so don't put
anything here that you don't want to share with the world.)

========================

This is due **INSTRUCTOR TODO**.

**Summary:** **INSTRUCTOR TODO**.

## Part 0: Nothing New

This project (and all other CUDA projects in this course) requires an NVIDIA
graphics card with CUDA capability. Any card with Compute Capability 2.0
(`sm_20`) or greater will work. Check your GPU on this
[compatibility table](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).
If you do not have a personal machine with these specs, you may use those
computers in the Moore 100B/C which have supported GPUs.

**HOWEVER**: If you need to use the lab computer for your development, you will
not presently be able to do GPU performance profiling. This will be very
important for debugging performance bottlenecks in your program.
